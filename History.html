        <h3>
            MEMOIRS of the FIRST SISTERS who came to HOLY TRINITY ACADEMY 
        </h3>

        <p>
            "Going to Mindanao” sounds much of an adventure to any Filipina SPC Sister who has not yet gone to this biggest island of the Philippine Republic. Economists, politicians, businessmen, job and land seekers - almost everyone speaks of Mindanao as the "Promised Land". Hence, the prospect of going to Buug, a town in Zamboanga del Sur (now Zamboanga Sibugay) in Mindanao was anxiously awaited by the four Sisters, namely: Sr. Esperanza Quitoriano, Sr. Jeanne de Rosario Marquez, Sr. Juanita de la Paz and Sr. Maria Ancilla Garcia. The assignment from Mother Provincial was received with mingled feelings. Her first long flight to the South was a thrilling experience for Sister Esperanza; she had to leave Manila ahead of the rest because she had to go for summer classes in Pagadian. For Sister Jeanne Du, it meant getting nearer home and seeing her loved ones more often. For Sister Juanita, the eldest in the group, it was like going to a far-off mission; while for Sister Ma. Ancilla, it meant treading familiar grounds with beautiful new horizons, for she had been in Aurora, another town of Zamboanga del Sur, for four years and had passed by Buug quite a few times. A few days of preparation in Manila - gathering beddings, kitchen utensils, getting a few pieces of furniture, silver, pots and pans, then on June 5,1970 the three sisters boarded MV Tayabas Bay, one of the biggest boats of Go Thong Company. All three looked forward to a happy and restful trip in their cozy cabin. Evening fell and morning came, only to find out that the boat was still docked at Manila Bay. No wonder they felt so warm in the little cabin which had only one round opening, about a foot in diameter. Things could have been better when the boat moved into the open sea, so they thought, and smiles beamed when the signal for departure sounded. Everything went fine until about midday when the dark colored water came leaking from one corner of the cabin; then the leak from the ceiling spread to the steward, but he very politely said, he was sorry that nothing could be done because the tilting of the ship to one side was causing the leak. With no better knowledge of nautical principles, the three meekly accepted their inevitable fate and cuddled like wet chicken into the double-decked bed in one corner. But the water on the floor was gradually increasing and rising, so the three had to jump out of their bed. In slippers with pails and mops, they started the CHAPTER 1 of their big cleaning job - big because it was to last until they finally reached Zamboanga City in the morning of June 8, 1970. Zamboanga City at last! Here, the Sisters had royal welcome. Noticing perhaps that the Sisters looked tired and haggard and certainly angry at the sight of what he thought was an inhabitable cabin, Mr. Expedito Marquez (Sister’s Jeanne’s father) would not allow the Sisters to carry a bit of luggage. He ordered them all into the waiting car while he and his men took care of all the luggage. Mrs. Marquez and the children waited in the house for a real warm welcome; a sharing of the funny and interesting experiences of the trip and then came the much-awaited rest. The following day saw a convoy - a buggy ahead, then a jeep and a big truck - all bound for Buug. June 9, 1970 at 6:00 P.M., Father Agustin Sagrado, S.J., the Parish Priest of Buug, got a shock when he heard that the Sisters had arrived. He had just started cleaning the FACULTY HOUSE that day. This was to be the house of the Sisters. A further frustration was that he wanted to give the Sisters a grand welcome with the playing of a band and the pealing of the church bells, but they had arrived so quietly. Who was to blame – SPC Mother Provincial, Sister Superior, or the Jesuit Superior for not giving due notice? Anyhow, the Sisters assured Father that everything would be alright. To a restaurant for supper, everyone agreed, as there was no more time to cook for supper. The owner of the restaurant was very much honored to have the Sisters and the Marquez’s, so he offered a real good supper to the whole group for free then back to the house which was located just beside the school. There were two rattan beds, hence the group found it more convenient to stretch out themselves on the floor for the night’s rest. After few minutes, everyone was fast asleep. No one new until morning that Sister Juanita had kept awake. The cool night made her shiver to the very marrow of her bones, so she spent the night opening up boxes trying in vain to find a blanket. The younger Sisters simply didn’t mind the cold and the dusty clothes they wore for sleeping. For Holy Mass the following morning to thank the Lord for a safe trip and for this new mission, a big signboard was at the door of the church: “Welcome to the Sisters of St. Paul Chartres!” At Mass, the Sisters were introduced to the parishioners by the parish priest and an eager throng vied with each other when the Mass was over trying to shake hands with the Sisters to welcome them. That same day marked the start of CHAPTER 2 of the great cleaning job. With Mr. Marquez on the land, everyone kept pace in a full swing scrubbing of walls, windows and floors. A few women came to help. This job was to last till the end of the month for there was also the big two-storey school building which had been abandoned during the whole summer. Much more important than the cleaning and the beautification was the real job that brought the Sisters to Buug. Rev. Fr. Simplicito Sampayao, S.J., then Superior of the Jesuit Mission in Zamboanga, invited the Sisters to maintain the school as a parochial school and also their intention of donating to the SPC Congregation the school lot, building, and all the equipment therein after a year of successful administration by the Sisters. The basic reason behind this turnover was the need for more priests devoting their time to pastoral work.

The following excerpt from a local newspaper relates a brief history of the settlement of Buug: “One day, many years ago, a hunter who has been on a chase for a number of days came home with a man-sized load of game and the biggest news immediately reached the Timo-ay or chieftain. The report might have been thus: “To the east, many hills beyond, is a land which could be the kind that we have been looking for all these years. From there, one can see the sun as it rises in the morning and as it sets in the evening. The land is flat, water is everywhere and there is suba. From the great winds it is protected by the wall of mountains and hills. It is not far from the source of the salt, for a little distance downhill is the sea. There are not big trees in there for this part is the bog! The hunter of course was a Subanon. “Bog” is the Subanon word for wooden area of land where no big trees abound, but it is not grassland. In recent connotation, “bog” denotes second growth forest at its early stage.

The news got the tribe so excited that the Timo-ay immediately dispatched scouts to check on the report. Few days later after the report was confirmed, a number of families led by Pasok Bandal went on an exodus, crossed the mountains, negotiated the forest and rivers, to finally come out into a hole in the primeval forest. There, indeed, was the land and the kind one that they had been looking for years wherein to settle for a home. There stretched the expanse of the land. It was flat. There was the river for their needs and the creeks, too, as they wiggled across the plains, and the land was protected from the big winds by walls of mountains and hills. This bog was a window from where they could reach the sky. The Bog was cleared, and the camp was built not far from the suba. Pasok Bandal, by virtue of his seniority, wisdom and prowess became the first Timo-ay. The hole that they had cleared soon grew wider. The camp had grown into a community. Because it was a land once a bog, the place came to be called Bog. Then settlers from other places came in, inevitably the community grew bigger and bigger until came the need for a school. In reporting about the community, the new teacher being influenced either by the Visayan word bu-og which means the same as Subanon “bog” or by the pronunciation of the native word with its long o, the teacher wrote its name and spelled it as BUUG for the first time.”

In 1975 the iron mine north of the plane was opened by the Samar Mining Company. Three years later, the construction of the Zamboanga City-Pagadian Highway enhanced the growth of the town. This was both a challenge and a blessing to the people. As new settlers from other provinces and places deluged in, came strange customs practices. This came as a blessing because with them came new knowledge and better technology. There was the challenge to the people because the new practices of the strangers threatened the life of the community, its customs and ways. There were only few choices left for the people to avoid intrusion, by running away to the hinterlands as the less daring among them had done - leaving their homes to resist the newcomers and their depraved ways, or to stay where they were and get integrated with the new settlers. With that set-up the people made their choice. To resist was futile. They stayed where they were to enrichment of their life. The resulting mixture of settlers - of Subanons and the newcomers from different places of origin - was a new community of individuals, resembling neither one nor the other, but one with a new personality that is distinctly Buug in attitude, thinking, bearing and outlook characterized by its ragged individualism. This was the setting, the background and the foundation on which the Sisters were asked to work and to build. It was during those years of great boon and prosperity, about eight years ago, that the Jesuits saw the need of putting up a Catholic School to meet the needs of the new settlers who were mostly Catholics. Under the able management and direction of Rev. Fr. Robert Walsh, S.J., the two-storey semi-concrete school was built and furnished to accommodate almost a thousand High School students. Upon the arrival of the SPC Sisters, however, the enrolment had dropped down due to the closing of the Samar Mining Company. A new company had taken over, but the work was on a much smaller scale. The school was to be the center for parochial activities and community development. This was clear from the provisions of the contract presented to the SPC Sisters. The Jesuits had a well-organized over-all plan for the entire mission. The development of Christian Communities and the formation of strong lay leadership through the coordinated action of the clergy, the religious and the laity were the principal targets. The acceptance of the contract by the SPC Congregation meet coordination with the already existing Plan of Action. Hence, while administering the school, the SPC Sisters were expected to take part in parish activities, like monthly meetings with priests, religious and laymen; sensitivity groupings, liturgical participation, leadership seminars and cooperative movements. The extension of the SEARSOLIN (Southeast Asia Rural Social Leadership Institute) and its establishment of Branch Office in Buug, headed by our own Sister Romualda de Jesus Jatico in August 1971 gave added impetus to the Sisters’ participation in the abovementioned activities.

Whether the Community had accepted fully the challenge for the Sisters’ whole-hearted cooperation in the development of all the people of Buug - Subanons, Moslems and Christians - or would they remain an isolated island managing the Holy Trinity Academy still remained to be seen. The first two years’ stay of the Sisters in Buug, however, had made apparent few developments as follows: 1. The eradication from the minds of the people that the Sisters are “stiff, unhuman beings, stoic in their discipline and difficult to deal with”. A few times, at least, they were heard to exclaim, “Mabait naman pala sila.” 2. The fostering of a friendly relationship with other schools - public, sectarian and Catholic - as demonstrated by their cooperation in parish-initiated activities like games and cultural programs. 3. The tapping of municipal officials towards honest and genuine leadership in community development through seminars until they formed a group called “Concerned Leaders of Buug.” (CLB). 4. The revitalizing of liturgical practices through the training of Barrio Liturgical Leaders. These leaders take charge of the Bible Services and give out Holy Communion in their respective barrios. 5. The re-awaking of the youth in their spiritual and social responsibilities. BIL (Basta Ikaw Lord) – the watchword of this group, so they work together for their spiritual upliftment, but they also get involved in social problems. A typical example of their daring concern for the poor was that one youth gave his life for this cause, got drowned while crossing a river in a barrio where they volunteered to give public talks on the need for honest elections. Several of them also braved the ghostly trails while carrying the ballot boxes to the town hall just to make sure they were not tampered upon.

All these became possible only because of the coordinated action in prayer and in work by the slowly developing communities of priests, religious and lay people. The work of the Sisters suddenly came to a temporary standstill when on October 11, 1971, all four Sisters met a car accident. Coming home after a meeting with the Sisters of Pagadian and Aurora on the Questionnaire for the Provincial Chapter, the jeep they were riding in got into a head-on collision with a pick-up. God’s plans have been his own secrets, but certainly this accident was part of the dying of the mustard seed to pave the way for the continuation of the Sisters of St. Paul apostolate among the people of Buug.

            Holy Trinity Academy is one of the four schools founded by the Society of Jesus (SJ) in the Jesuit Mission District of Zamboanga del Sur (now Zamboanga Sibugay). It was established on July 6, 1966 in response to the appeal of the fastgrowing community of Buug for a high school education that would prepare the youth for the responsibilities of Christian involvement in the Church and in the community. At that time, the town itself was young, having founded only five years before. The presence of the Samar Mining Company, a cool invigorating climate, and wide arable lands attracted people from all over the Visayas and Mindanao to settle in this area. Starting with the first and second years of High School Education (HS), the school gradually added the third and fourth years, and in April 1970 the first group of graduates received their Diploma. The period after Vatican II saw more and more changes in the Church’s pastoral directions. It also ushered the problem of scarcity in the priestly and religious vocations. Meantime, the demands of the parish and the school were getting too heavy for one priest to handle. Desiring to devote more time to missionary work and grassroots social action, the Jesuit Fathers decided to turn over Holy Trinity Academy to the Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres (SPC) in 1970. Since the very beginning, its mission orientation has remained a distinctive characteristic of HTA Education. All its students and teachers have been actively involved in the parish activities and social action projects. In 1999, its members of the Board of Trustees decided to change the name of the school from Holy Trinity Academy to Saint Paul School of Buug, Inc. (SPSBI). The following year (2000), SPSBI High School Department has been granted full Government Recognition. In the year 2011, the school has completed the Grade School (GS) Department. The Nursery, Kinder I, Kinder II, and Grades One to Six have been housed in a constructed eight-classroom building. The Grade School Department has been granted full Government Recognition in 2016. In the year 2015, the government has given SPSBI the Provisional Permit to operate the Senior High School (SHS) Program offering Academic, Tech-Voc/TVL Tracks with Strands: GAS – General Academic Strand; AFA- Food Processing NC I; HE – Dressmaking NC II; IA – Carpentry NC II; and ICT – Computer Hardware Services. Two years later, the government has given SPSB the Provisional Permit to Operate the Senior High School (SHS) Program Academic/Tech-Voc Tracks with the following Strands: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM); Accountancy, Business & Management (ABM); Humanities & Social Sciences (HUMSS); HE – Cookery, Bread & Pastry Production; Hairdressing, Beauty Care; and ICT – Animation. Today the school has grown not only in number, but also in the quality and scope of its curricular and cocurricular offerings.

It is still very much of a mission school dedicated to the three-fold ideal of Truth, Justice and Love, and committed to the goals of national development and Christian service in the home, the community and the Church. Truly, the Lord has blessed us. The seeds of evangelization are now sown from the earliest stage of Christian education. Throughout these years of devoted service, the Holy Trinity Academy (HTA), now St. Paul School of Buug, Inc. (SPSBI) has seen constant growth and progress. Like the mustard seed, the smallest of all seeds which becomes a big tree and shelters the birds of the air, the school has grown, sheltered and taught the young and old in several parts of the province of Zamboanga Sibugay. Each of the Sisters who has guided this institution, has done her own best way what she could to contribute to the making of HTA as it was popularly known, now SPSBI. HTA/SPSBI continues her noble task of producing men and women of enlightenment and culture abreast with the times and efficiently equipped to face life like a good Catholic; of providing the youth with every means of attaining happiness both in this life and in the next. She welcomes all, young and old, rich or poor alike to whom she spreads the love of Christ without prejudice or discrimination. She lives up to her motto, “THE CHARITY OF CHRIST URGET US.” The administration continues to look into the needs of the school and is trying its best to meet these needs so as to give an education according to the objectives for which the school exists. The cooperative endeavors of the Sisters and the people of Buug have resulted in the gradual improvement and expansion of the school. It has become a powerhouse of Christian youth growing in virtues of wisdom, truth, justice, mercy and love bringing to the people of God the Good News of God’s love. The History of HTA/SPSBI will go on with the grace of God from its humble beginnings… passionately proclaiming the Good News and the love of God toward its shining future… Continuously SERVING ALL BEYOND EXPECTATION!

CARITAS CHRISTI URGET NOS!
